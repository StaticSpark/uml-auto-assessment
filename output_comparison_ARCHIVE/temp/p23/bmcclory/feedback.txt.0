Ok, so you're really close. 
- fgetc gets a character from a file. Where is that character going? fgetc returns it, but you're not using it.

Note [1] below... I bet you put that there as a way to get data out of the file. Atoi doesn't get data from anywhere, it converts a string into a number. The string you are giving it will result in some number, which will be the same number all the time as the string doesn't change, and that number is useless.

My first point above is the important one.

It's almost there. Took me sub-1 minute to fix. That little to change.
