What are those extra braces for below?
The TA didn't seem to catch them. They certainly don't belong there. I'd like to know why you think they do.

========== p2.c ==========
#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
  int number;

    printf( "Enter Number Here\n" );
    scanf( "%d",&number);{        <--------- this brace
    printf( "\n%d\n",number );
    }         <----------- and this one.... why?
    printf( "**** END OF PROGRAM ****\n" ); <---- also, you don't need this at all
}
