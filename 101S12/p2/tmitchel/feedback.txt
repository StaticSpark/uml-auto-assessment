Having run your program, I am assessing an additional -1 for compiler warnings.
-1 warnings
-1 late
-1 no header

Please see me if you can't figure out what's wrong with the code (and see my last email).

-Mark

========== p2.c ==========
#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
  int number;

    printf( "Enter Number Here\n" );
    scanf( "%d",&number);{
    printf( "\n%d\n",number );
    }
    printf( "**** END OF PROGRAM ****\n" );
}
