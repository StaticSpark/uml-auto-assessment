Your code has a lot going on with it. 

You did not follow the parallel instruction. One string of input must be fed to all three machines, having only been typed in by the user once.

I don't even know how to assess if your logic is correct. There's functions going everywhere. It's messy.

When I figured out how to make the tests work on your program, I get stuck inputting for L2, which doesn't work.
