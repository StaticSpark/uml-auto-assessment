You call getchar() twice in each loop, once in the conditional, and again in the body, so only every other character is being processed. This breaks everything.

Your code that you passed in and your paper submission differ. The electronic code doesn't ever stop running. The handed in code works, but works poorly. The languages don't have a chance to be right because of the double call to getchar in the main function.
