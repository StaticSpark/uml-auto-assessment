Your comment at the bottom is very telling. When you are in that situtaion is when you must come see someone, myself, Mike, or anyone who can help, to show you some basic structure that will help. From there you'd be able to put it together.

I can infer that you did this mostly at the last minute, so you did not have the opportunity to come get help. Hopefully the lesson learned will be to start earlier so there is room in the schedule for a few days of asking questions and getting answers.

If you came to me with exactly what you said in that bottom comment, I would have shown you exactly what you needed.
