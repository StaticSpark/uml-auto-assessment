You have many compilation errors. I can explain a few of them to you.

The operator -> only works when the expression on the left is a pointer to a struct, and the expression on the right is a field name within that struct.
	ptr_to_struct -> field_name
You cannot use -> on a local struct, in that case you use the period.
	actual_struct.field_name

"make_node" and "insert_node" take the raw data to be stored in the node and create a node around it. They do not take a pre-formed node as an argument.

"make_node" does not need to be called at all from the driver program. It is used inside "insert_node", so "insert_node" handles everything.

p44.c: you have a } on line 40 that doesn't seem to belong there. That prematurely ends the main function. That is causing most of the following errors.

Your forward_start and reverse_start functions are defined in p44.c, which means their prototypes should also be in p44.c, at the top, NOT in the linked_list.h header file. That header file is for functions that are in the linked_list.c code file.

The forward_start and reverse_start functions will not work.
	 ptr -> next = data; makes no sense
The 'next' field is a pointer to a node, and the 'data' at that moment is not a defined variable. Inside a node, there is a field named 'data', which is of a completely different type than the 'next' field.

Why are you counting (with variable i)? what is a "NUM" type for?
