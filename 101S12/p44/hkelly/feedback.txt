Does not exit on EOF. In this case, you need to watch for scanf's return value, as it returns EOF when it finds EOF. Weird, i know, but you should have seen this in testing.

Did you test it?
How did you stop the program?

You also are writing to uninitialized memory.
You create a new node, but only allocate enough memory for DATA_T, which is just a float. 
	newnode = (NODE*)malloc(sizeof(DATA_T));
Corrected:
	newnode = (NODE*)malloc(sizeof(NODE));
