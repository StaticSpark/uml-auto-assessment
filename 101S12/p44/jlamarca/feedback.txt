Does not compile.

You didn't use the multiple files. You stuck all the functions and definitions into one file, and it didn't work out. 

All you had to do was fill in the blanks of the files I gave you.

Even when I compiled it with just the one file, it still didn't build, so i can't assess it, and you receive a 1.
