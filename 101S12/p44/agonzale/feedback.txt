This is not a good submission. It does not compile, for which my policy is a grade of 1.

That's harsh, so I tried to figure out how well it would work if it could compile (often a futile effort, as if it worked, it would compile)...

There is a lot broken. There is a lot missing. There are statements that simply aren't valid C expressions. 

One issue I see multiple times in your p44.c is declarations of local variables. Declarations always follow the same form:

type name ;

or 

type name = initial_value ;

You are using names of variables as types. Types must be created with a typedef or a built-in type, not arbitrary things.  "linked_list" is not a data type. The concept of a linked list is built out of the NODE data type.

You didn't even change the payload typedef (DATA_T) to be a float, as was requested. That was a one line change.

You have a countdown from 999 that makes no sense to me. What is x?

What this looks like is you simply did not have the time. This appears to be code in the exploratory phase, plus rushing to get something in. 

Not your best work.

My recommendations: study how structs and typedefts work. Study how pointers to structures work (it's pretty basic, just a slight addition to your previous concept of pointers). This will all be on the final, which is your big opportunity to make up the loss of points here.

Good luck.
