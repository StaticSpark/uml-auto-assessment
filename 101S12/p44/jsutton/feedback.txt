Your print function does not recurse, so it just prints the first value over and over again, infinitely. 

The list appears to build in memory properly, which is very good.

There is a weird memory error caused by your line in p44.c that creates the first node. Here's teh trick: you didn't need to do it at all. The insert_node function works fine if the start pointer is NULL, or empty.

But that first-node line in p44.c is strange.
