Program works fine. 

The body of the while loop must be indented to indicate that it is inside the while. (see below)

Otherwise, no problems. Good job. I'm going to let that indent slide this time.

What does the variable "count" do? From what I can see, nothing. Spend a few more minutes looking over your work. If you spot something that's no longer necessary, take it out.

  while((count=getchar())!=EOF)

  a=a+1; <<<<<< should be indented 1 more level

  return 0;
