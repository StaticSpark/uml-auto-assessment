Your program works great, but...

Do not submit your a.out file. Only submit source code.

Your 'main' definition is incomplete. It needs a return type and arguments. The lack of return type generated a compiler warning.

Please complete the header box. You only need to do it out once, then you can insert it in to every program you do.

Why is the return indented? It's not in a conditional body or another function. It should be at the same level as everything else in main.

What does the variable "c" do? From what I can tell, nothing. 

Your output looks messy, as it appears immediately after the user's input with no space or newline.

  while ( ( c = getchar() ) != EOF )
    count ++ ;

  printf( "%d characters\n", count );

    return 0;
