Program works. Prompting would be nice, as you are dealing with a human user. 

Your indentation is off. The close brace for a conditional should be aligned with that conditional, in this case the "while." see below.

int main( int argc , char* argv[] ) {

  int y ;
  while( getchar() != EOF ) {
      y = y+1 ; <<<<<< actually good. keep this here.
    } <<<<<<<< too much indent. Should align with the "while" above it
  printf( "\nThe number of characters entered is :\n%d\n" , y ) ;
  return 0 ;
