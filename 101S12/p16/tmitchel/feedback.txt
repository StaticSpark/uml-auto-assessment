Don't put a newline between a function declaration and the opening bracket.

This program prints out a line %d Characters for each char entered. The goal of the program is to count the characters, then print out the final count at the end. 

I don't believe that you tested this program, saw that result, and said to yourself, "ah, perfect!"

This could easily be fixed by putting the print statement outside of the loop.

Your indentation is also wrong inside the while loop. Both the y++ and the printf are at the same level, so they should look it.

What's with all the extra space in the header?
