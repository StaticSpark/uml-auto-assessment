No header -1
You have no prompting to the user whatsoever. if you're dealing with keyboard i/o, you're dealing with a user, so you need to be nice. -1

What does the variable 'x' do? Nothing at all. Spend the time to read over your stuff. You also have a rediculous amount of extra space between the printf and the return, which makes me think there may have been some copy-paste action going on.

do NOT copy others' solutions. If you are having trouble (which I believe you are), then come see me, and we'll figure out what you're missing, and put you on track. 

========== p16.c ==========
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

  int x;
  int y;

  while((x=getchar())!=EOF){

    y++;
  }


  printf("\n%d\n", y);





  return 0;
}
