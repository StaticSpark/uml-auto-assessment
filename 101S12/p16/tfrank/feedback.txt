Good. Program works perfectly. Prompting would be nice. Good work initializing the variable 'c' before the loop, so it has a real value when you check it. (A lot of people missed that nuance)

I'll let you slide on the prompting. Good indenting.

ps: don't put a blank line between a function definition and it's opening brace (in this case main)
