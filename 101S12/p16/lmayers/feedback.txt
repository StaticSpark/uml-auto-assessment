If you are going to have a while loop with a body (using braces) PUT THE BODY CODE IN THE BODY, not on the same line as the while. Really, what's the point? (see below)

Your program works fine. Output is messy, as it appears immediately after the user's input with no space or newline. 

If you spent more time testing your work you would have seen this strange output.
