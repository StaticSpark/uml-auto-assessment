Program works fine, but...
- header is incorrect

There are other ways to make this program work, that don't involve pre-setting a variable to -1. I don't just mean subracting 1 off later. This works, but think if you can come up with any other ways.

========== p16.c ==========
/* Martin Kibusi */
/* Count Characters */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc,char*argv[]){
  char n, i; 
  printf("Please enter characters ");
  
  n =0;
  for(i = -1; n != EOF ; i++){
    n = getchar();
   
  }
  printf("\nThe number of characters are %d \n ", i );
  
  return 0;
}
