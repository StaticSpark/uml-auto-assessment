Good job. A few pro-tips:

- put a blank line between your include and your first function, also between the header and the includes.

- If you have a "for" loop (or any loop) with no body, it's ok to put a semicolon at the end and not bother with the braces. 
for(i = 0; cond ; i++);

- Your final newline is made with a putchar. That easily could have been included in the printf above it, after the number was printed.

That's it. Pretty nitpicky stuff, so you good job.
