Program works fine, but your code style leaves much to be desired.
- Header block is wrong format and incomplete. See website.
- last bracket of the "while" is indented incorrectly. The closing bracket of a conditionals body should be aligned with the conditional statement. you indented it. (see below)

Program p16
This program counts the number of characters entered by the user until it reaches EOF.  It then returns the number of characters entered.

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

  int x,y=0;

  while((x=getchar())!=EOF){
    y++;
    } <<<<<<<< too much indent here
  printf("\n%d\n",y);

  return 0;
}
