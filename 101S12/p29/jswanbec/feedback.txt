Why did you find the need to re-format the playRound code? The code is the same, but it's been re-indented and the newlines have been removed. I instructed you not to touch it, so I'm wondering what you did that caused the formatting to change.

More importantly, your brackets are off. 

For example:
  if ( a == b)
    {
    return draw;
    }

is incorrect. Those braces are indented too far. The braces must match the keyword that they are helping define, in this case, the 'if'. Here is the same code, corrected:

  if ( a == b)
  {
    return draw;
  }

For having bracket indents off, -.5

Otherwise solid program.
