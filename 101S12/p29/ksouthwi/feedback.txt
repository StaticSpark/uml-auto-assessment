Good job. You sort of did it the hard way, but it works great.

By the "hard way" I mean that there are many cases that could be logically reduced, so you don't need quite as many "if" conditions.

For example, you look for a draw in every block, where every block is triggered on a particular player 1 input. You could have checked for a tie once at the beginning, then proceed with the rest of the checks knowing that a tie has not occurred.

But your program is solid, so good job.
