I did not get a seg fault when I ran it. My guess is you were calling it without providing a first argument. When it goes to check argv[1], if there isn't one, you will get a seg fault. So on the command line it MUST be called with a file to read as an argument.

Some of your indentation is a little wrong, see below.

It only processes the first number in the file, instead of all of them.

/* I tried for hours to write this without segmentation faults, but could not determine where I am getting one. I fixed all errors and warnings but then once I ran it, I got the segmantation fault. */
