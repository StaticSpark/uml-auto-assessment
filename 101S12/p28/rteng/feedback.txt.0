Two big things:
- You need to print the digit sum of ALL the numbers in the file, not just the last one.
- Your digitsum variable in digitsumfunction is never intitialized, so your answer is almost always wrong

Small things:
"digitsumfunction" is a redundant name. It is obvious that it's a function. If you want to very clear, make the name of the function a verb of some kind, as functions *do* things. 
Try not to use the same exact phrase in names of multiple things, but I think you get that, and that's what you were trying to do.
