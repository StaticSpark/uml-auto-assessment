You have global variables, but the data you store in them is NOT global scope. 
The fact that you reset the sum variable before you call "digitsum" is indicative that the data that will be stored in sum within digitsum is local only to digitsum.

Having a global variable only for the purpose of resetting values is a dangerous practice that is prone to error. 

Sum does not need to be accessed outside of digitsum, as you are retuning it. 
nextint is passed into digitsum, and therefore does not need to be globally shared.
rem is also a local variable to digitsum, not used anywhere else.

The purpose of these variables is not global. Don't make them global.
