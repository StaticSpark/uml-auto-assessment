Your code is cramped. Separate logical sections with some whitespace. Too cramped and it's hard to read. 

Your indentation is wrong in the digitsum function's definition. The opening brace should be left-aligned. your indents are also very shallow. They should be at least 4 characters.

Most importantly, main is not the first function defined in the file. It should be. 

oh, and your output doesn't put any whitespace between the output values, so it all runs together.
