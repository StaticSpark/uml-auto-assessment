Only processes first number from file, instead of all of them.

Also gives a result that is one higher than correct. (should be 9, returns 10)

Your a/b/c variable names are unclear. I don't know what your idea is. I don't know why you need those variables. Give them meaningful names. The process of giving them meaningful names often helps your idea develop.
