- Your count function works.
- You do no file i/o, you read in the number from the argument.
What was asked of you was to read in the first argument to be *the name of the file* where the numbers can be found.

You then open that file with fopen etc, read numbers from there, and run the count function for each number it finds in the file. Missed a decent chunk of the program.

Also, stylistically, you should put the main function first in the file. You'll the need to add a function declarator for count at the top.
