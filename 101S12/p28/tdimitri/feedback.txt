You are so painfully close.

Your main function is fine. 

It looks like you tried to use a little bit of recursive structure to make an interative function. As you may have learned, it doesn't always work out. Here, you check if num < 10. If so, you just return that. Great.
If not, you then do a while loop, looping on num being >= 10. What happens when num goes under 10? You want to do what the previous "if" case does, which is finsih the job.

What this boils down to, is that you can simplify that function quite  bit. Get rid of that first "if". The while loop is basically an "if" that gets asked over and over again, and when the loop is done, the code after the loop is only run when that "if" question has failed, so you KNOW that condition.

You now get the math that needs to happen. redesign the function knowning that to make a simple, correct solution. Think it through. Experiment. You can do it.
