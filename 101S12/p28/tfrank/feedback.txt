Nice work.
Since when do you check for a valid file pointer? while it's a good thing in general, it's not needed in this class. I promise all the files will be valid, and all input will be correct. Unless you found this motivation elsewhere... please explain.

Indentation is beautiful. Without it this would be a steaming mess. But it's nice.

You need to do MUCH better with your variable naming. What is z versus a? they have no meaning, but the variables must serve explicit purposes, or they wouldn't exist. Find a name for them.
