This program sums the character code values of the file. This is not the desired behavior.

You open the file correctly. fgetc pulls characters from the file. You want to pull whole integer numbers. fscanf would be a better solution to do that, as it can find whole numbers intelligently. Your function just sums the two values, which you feed back into itself through the loop, creating a whole-file summation. This is not right either.

Your function will take a single number, add the digits of that number together, and return that sum. 

Your main function will call the digit-sum function on each number that it finds in the file, and print out the result for each.
