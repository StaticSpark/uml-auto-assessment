- Does not use a separate function to process digit sums. Looks like it works, but was not abstracted into a function.

Errors:
gcc -Wall -ansi -g p28.c -o a28
p28.c: In function ‘main’:
p28.c:20: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘fscanf’ from incompatible pointer type
So let's look at your call to fscanf (below)

    while ( fscanf(argv[1], "%d", &num) != EOF){ << needs a FILE*, you're giving it a string. You already used argv[1] to create the file pointer, which you named "testdata28". Use that here, as the argument to fscanf. You did it right in fclose below.
	a++;

    while ( argv[1] != 0 ) {

	num = num / 10;
	sum = sum + a;
