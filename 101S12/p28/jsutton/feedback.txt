Program works great. 

Only problems:
- main must be the first function defined in the file. Move "sum" below main, then add a prototype above it. 
- Your variable names are not descriptive of their function. What is x, what is y? why is the file handler named "digits"? That could mean anything, and it NOT indicative that it's a file.
