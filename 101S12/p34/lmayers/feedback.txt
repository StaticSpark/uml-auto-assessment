Program works in most cases, but has some problems.

The string is not stored in allocated memory. This is dangerous. gets does not malloc up memory for you. It expects your pointer to point at a block of memory that you already allocated. You did not.
This could have been solved by changing word to a fixed-length array of characte
rs: char string[20]

Why do you have a variable named "sum"? Summing has nothing to do with how that variable is actually used. It is actually holding the result of if the string is a palindrome or not. A better name, like "result" or "palindrome_result" would be more clear.

Having said that, your palindrome function is excellent.

Pro tip: is what you wrote:
	start_char == end_char || start_char > end_char
Not the same as
	start_char >= end_char
?
