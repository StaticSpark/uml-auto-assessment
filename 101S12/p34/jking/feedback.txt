The compiler warning was there for a good reason. What does the first expression of a "for" loop do? It is used to initialize variables. You are not doing that. You are simply stating variables. A variable name, as an expression, returns the value stored in that variable. No side effect occurs.

I want you to respond to me, right now, by email, explaining in your own words what a for loop does, and how it works.

-1 errors
-1 is_palindrome is not recursive

/* Gives me a warning "left hand operand of comma expression has no effect"  in the for loop. After researching, It is just a syntax error when using two initializers or counters and the suggested fix is a boolean operater such as &&. However, this leaves values unused. Ive opted to stick to the comma sinceit compiles and runs fine.*/
