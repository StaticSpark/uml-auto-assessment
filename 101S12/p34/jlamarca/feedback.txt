Your recursive statement is wrong because you never make one. In the recursive case, you need to call the function is_palindrome again from within is_palindrome. 

There are three cases you need to cover:
Case 1: There is 1 or 0 characters in the substring, return YES (1)
Case 2: The outer two characters do NOT match, return NO (0)
Case 3: The outer two characers do match, return the result of the recursive call:
	is_palindrome(the_string, start_char+1 , end_char-1 )

Now onto your main function.

The program calls for you to scan a string from standard input. You elected to take the string from a command-line argument, which is incorrect. The user will not be able to give you the data you want, as you are expecting it to come in a different way than what the specification states.

There are some questionable moves with assigning the value of argv[1] to x, which just copies the pointer. Why not use argv[1] in place of x in the rest of the program? They contain exactly the same thing.

x,y, and z are not descriptive. Looking at the call to is_palindrome, I have no idea if what you re doing is right. I have to reference earlier code, adding difficulty for the reader.

Overall, it does not work. It looks like you were thrashing on this one.

-1 does not work

/* The is_palindrome function is returning true if the string is one long but
   once it surpasses one letter, it returns false. My recursive statement is
   wrong but im not sure as to how to fix it. */
